	<h1>Bike Facilities</h1>
	<p>People bike for fun, exercise, and transportation. Cyclists include children on their way to school, commuters heading to work, athletes training, and seniors out for a relaxing ride. Bicycling is an active travel mode that can factor into a healthy lifestyle and it is an economical transportation option because bicycles burn calories instead of pricey fossil fuels. Bicycling as a travel mode is easily combined with walking and transit, which provides cyclists with more choice in how they move about their lives.</p>

	<p>People who bike are vulnerable users of the transportation system, accounting for a growing share of crashes and a disproportionate share of injuries in the region. The majority of the Boston region still lacks adequate bicycle infrastructure, limiting the likelihood that people choose cycling as a transportation option.</p>

	<p>The Boston Region MPO monitors the bicycle network available throughout the region. Bicycle facilities include off-road trails that are often shared with pedestrians, as well as on-road lanes and cycle tracks where people ride alongside motorized vehicles. The MPO measures the total miles of facilities available to cyclists. The on- and off-road bicycle facilities in the region combine to create the Boston Region Bicycle Network. Understanding this network and where it needs to grow is an important part of planning for bicycle transportation in and around Boston today and in the future.</p>

	<h3> Current State of Off-Road Bicycle Facilities </h3>
	<p>The map documents the status of off-road bicycle facilities (shared-use paths) in each municipality. Facility mileage is broken down into three categories: 1) existing, 2) under construction or in design, or 3) envisioned or planned. The bar graph illustrates the total miles of each bicycle facility status in each municipality.</p>
