	<h1>Crashes</h1>
	
	<p>One of the MPO’s goals is to improve safety on the roadway network. 
	For this reason, MPO staff track injuries and fatalities from crashes throughout the region 
	to monitor the safety of the Boston region’s transportation network, and use this information to prioritize future investments in the system.
	</p>
	
	<p>The visualizations on this page show data from the Massachusetts Crash Data System for the years 2005 to 2014. 
	 For more information about these safety performance measures and related data, visit the Crashes section on the About page.
